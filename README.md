# UC Berkeley Cyber Security Final Project
## Authored by Sheikh Ahmed
## Attack, Defense & Analysis of a Vulnerable Network


In this project I worked as a Security Engineer, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC Analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate.
I started by confirming that newly created Kibana alerts are working, after which I monitored live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that weren't reflected in the alerting system.
I reported all the findings with appropriate analysis in this project.
